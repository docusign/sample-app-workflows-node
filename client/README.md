## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the Vite development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally. Useful for testing the production build before deploying.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to analyze the code for potential errors and enforce coding standards. This script ensures no unused ESLint directives are present and limits the number of warnings to zero.
